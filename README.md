# Battleship
Welcome to Battleship! Rules: Ten ships are placed in the ocean (none are immediately adjacent to each other). You do not know where the ships are. Try hitting the ships by indicating a specific row and column number. Try to sink the fleet with as few shots as possible; the best possible score would be 20.
